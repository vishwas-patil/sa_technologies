# Tendable Coding Assessment

## Usage

```sh
bundle
ruby questionnaire.rb
```

## Goal

The goal is to implement a survey where a user should be able to answer a series of Yes/No questions. After each run, a rating is calculated to let them know how they did. Another rating is also calculated to provide an overall score for all runs.

## Requirements

Possible question answers are: "Yes", "No", "Y", or "N" case insensitively to answer each question prompt.

The answers will need to be **persisted** so they can be used in calculations for subsequent runs >> it is proposed you use the pstore for this, already included in the Gemfile

After _each_ run the program should calculate and print a rating. The calculation for the rating is: `100 * number of yes answers / number of questions`.

The program should also print an average rating for all runs.

The questions can be found in questionnaire.rb
